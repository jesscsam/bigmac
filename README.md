### Description
A visualisation of user data from a European adult online forum. This data includes user characteristics and an AI-calculated risk factor, showing how likely that individual is to enter into online sex trade.
To view the visualisation, click [here](https://jesscsam.github.io/programmeerproject/) or on the title above.
I've also created a product video, which can be viewed [by clicking here](https://youtu.be/s2oRaZQj_0g).

### Features
This visualisation includes several interactive features, namely:
* A toggle-able legend for the sunburst graph. Check the checkbox, and the legend appears.
* A link between the sunburst and the pie chart: click on a segment in the outermost ring of the sunburst, and the pie chart shows data for that subgroup.
* A link between the sunburst and the bar chart: click on a segment in the innermost ring of the sunburst, and the bar chart shows data for that gender.
* A drop-down menu to select an age group to show data for in the pie chart
* A drop-down menu to select which type of interaction to show data for in the bar chart
